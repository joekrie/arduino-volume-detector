# Arduino Volume Detector

* Report: https://joekrie.github.io/arduino-volume-detector
* Slideshow: https://joekrie.github.io/arduino-volume-detector/slideshow
* Code: [volume-detector.ino](volume-detector.ino)

To do:
* Comment code
* Arduino tech specs
* A block diagram
* A memory map
* An estimate of processor bandwidth that is needed
* An estimate of memory that is needed, both volatile and non-volatile
* An I/O map
* Misc. constraints that are placed on the software by hardware (power requirement, etc)
* Misc. constraints that are place on the hardware by software (software debug access)
