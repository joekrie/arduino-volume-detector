# Introduction

This project is a volume detector component that gives the end user an indication of how loud an environment is. It is controlled by an Arduino Uno. Such a component can have many uses:
* Warn workers in a construction site when sound levels are too lound, warranting the need for hearing protection
* Utility for the hearing impared, such as a baby monitor that gives a visual signal when a baby's volume reaches a certain threshold
